# DressesApp

This project is similar to the "Bow Ties" project from the book "Core Data by Tutorials Fourth Edition"
Aaron Douglas, Saul Mora, Matthew Morey and Pietro Rea; in this case, I did it with Dresses.

Adapted to the version of iOS 14.5 where the main difference is in the initialization of the managedContext and with differences in the implementation of the appDelegate because it incorporates new properties to access the "persistentContainer".
